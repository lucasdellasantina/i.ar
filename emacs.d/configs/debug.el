Files with more characters than this are truncated to this limit and a
truncation notice is appended.  This prevents accidentally loading huge
files (e.g., large log files, binary blobs) into the AI context, which
would consume excessive tokens and slow down responses.
Uses character count (not byte count) because insert-file-contents
decodes the file into Emacs internal representation, and AI token
consumption correlates more with character count than byte count.
Set to nil to disable truncation (read full file regardless of size)."
